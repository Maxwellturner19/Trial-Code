Game to test time for user to solve maths Question

import time
import random

rand_n1 = random.randint(1,20) # create a random number between 1 and 20
rand_n2 = random.randint(1,20) # create a random number between 1 and 20
solution = rand_n1 + rand_n2

input('Welcome to the math challenge! Press Enter when ready...') # wait for user to start the challenge

t0 = time.time()

print(str(rand_n1) + " + " + str(rand_n2))

answer = input("Type in your answer and hit Enter: ")

t1 = time.time()

time = round(t1 - t0,2)

print("The answer is " + str(solution))
print("It took you " + str(time) + " seconds to solve the problem.")
